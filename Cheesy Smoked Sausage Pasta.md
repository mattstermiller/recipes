# Cheesy Smoked Sausage Pasta

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1 lb. Smoked Turkey Sausage, sliced
- 1 cup diced onion about 1 medium onion
- 1 tbsp. minced garlic about 2-3 fresh cloves
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 10-oz. can diced tomatoes, with or without chiles (like rotel)
- 1/2 cup milk or heavy cream
- 8 oz. dry pasta like rotini, penne or farfalle
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup shredded Cheddar-Jack cheese
- 1/3 cup sliced scallions for garnish

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a 5 quart saute pan over medium-high heat.
2. Add onions and sausage and cook until lightly browned. Add garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.
3. Add chicken broth, tomatoes (undrained), milk, pasta, and seasonings. Bring the mixture to a boil, cover, and reduce
   heat to low. Simmer for about 15 minutes, or until pasta is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed.
3. Turn off the heat and stir in 1/2 cup of cheese. Sprinkle remaining cheese on top and cover for about five minutes to
   allow cheese to melt. Top with sliced scallions and serve. (You could also broil for a couple of minutes to melt the
   cheese).
