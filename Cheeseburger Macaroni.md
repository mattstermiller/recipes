### Sauce Packet

- 1 tbsp cornstarch (or flour)
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp garlic
- 1 tsp salt

## Directions

1. Brown ground beef in a large skillet. Drain.
2. Add hot water, milk, pasta and "sauce packet" ingredients.
3. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer 12 minutes or until pasta is tender.
4. In the last few minutes of cook time, add cheese, stir and re-cover.
