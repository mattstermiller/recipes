# Jalapeño Popper Chicken Taquitos

## Ingredients

- 3-4 chicken breasts
- 8 ounces cream cheese
- 1/3 cup jarred whole or sliced jalapeños, roughly chopped (or more, to taste)
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 16 taco-sized tortillas
- 1 1/2 cups of your favorite shredded cheese
- Optional toppings: fresh cilantro, additional jalapeños, dipping sauces such as ranch, salsa, green goddess dressing

## Directions

1. Add chicken, 1/2 cup water, cream cheese, jalapeños, garlic powder, salt, and cumin to crockpot. Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours (for frozen chicken) or on high 3-4 hours (for thawed chicken).
2. Minutes before serving, preheat the oven to 425 and grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.
3. Use two forks to shred chicken and stir it in with the other contents of the crockpot.
4. Heat tortillas in the microwave for a few seconds to soften them up. (This will make them easier to work with.) Sprinkle cheese in the middle of each tortilla (just divide the cheese evenly between all of the tortillas).
5. Top cheese with 2-3 tablespoons of shredded chicken mixture. Roll tortillas tightly into a log-shape taquito.
6. Place taquitos on baking sheet and spray heavily with cooking spray. Bake 10-15 minutes until cheese is melted and tortillas begin to brown. (For crispier taquitos, switch the oven to broil for 2-3 minutes - watch carefully so they don't burn!)
7. Serve warm with dipping sauces and toppings if desired.
